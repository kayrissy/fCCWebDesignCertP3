  <p>Gardening can be very rewarding, healthy, and delicious.</p>
  <p>There's nothing more rewarding than eating what you've grown for several weeks to months</p>
  <p>First you will need to consider the area you will be using:</p>
    <li>No Yard: Expore <code>indoor</code> options</li>
    <li>Small Yard: raised garden beds are <code>ideal for small areas</code>. Planting crops closely together will help save on weeding time later down the road as well.</li>
    <li>Large areas: weed block is <code>highly</code> recommended for organic gardening</li>
    <p></p>

  <p>Once you determined the area you will be gardening, then you will need to purchase appropriate seeds for the area, climate, and soil type.
  <li>For indoor gardening: Choose plants that are smaller. Vine plants are not recommended. Some great indoor plants include lettuce, herbs, microgreens. If you have an option of larger, deeper containers then root veggies are also an option IE carrots and radishes.</li>
    <li>For raised garden beds: the growing season is expanded some due to warmer soil as its above ground. You can expand on what can be grown indoors and plant close together to prevent weeds as the plants grow. Another option for the raised garden beds is fruits ie strawberries.</li>
    <li>Large area gardening: you will do best to use weed block. Some with holes will go around the plants and be sure to add solid rows of weed block for walking. Cover the rows with mulch such as straw, grass clippings, or even wool. Add to the options by putting in panels and trellis'.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Planting_and_care">
    <header>Planting and care</header>
  <p><li>Indoors: The benefits of planting indoors is that you can start whenever you want. You avoid weeds by purchasing soil. Main care includes sunlight and watering.</li>
  <li>Raised Garden Bed: Plant closely, weeding and consistent watering is important early. Continue to water and ensure soil is moist.</li>
  <li>Large Area Gardening: The ground will need to be worked first. Tilling and cultivating is nessecary. Plant according to seed packet directions. Use weed block with holes for spacing. Weeding will need to take place until the plants are large enough to fill out the weed block area. Consist watering is also important</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Harvesting"><header>Harvesting</header></section>
  <p> Harvesting is the best and most rewarding step. Nothing bets the first crop from your garden</p>
  <p>Trim lettucce, herbs and microgreens as they grow.</p>
  <p>Root veggies will start to stick out of the soil. Pull as they become ready.
    Note: cover potatoes if they start to come out of soil early to avoid rotting. Carrots can be harvested at any point. They will continue to grow and be fine to harvest both early, mid and late in timing.</p>
    <p>peas and bush beans can be harvested for periods of time. They will continue to come up with veggies for a timeframe.</p>
    <p>Vine plants tend to be ready when they easily fall off vine. Cucumbers are typically first. Squash will be later in fall.</p>
    <p><code>Youtube</code> and homesteading websites are also a great source whenever you're not sure.</p>
